#[The Hackend Project](http://deepakkarki.github.io/blog/2015/08/08/The-Hackend-Project/)

This repository contains the various code snippets and notes I write as a part of the hackend project. Each week will have it's own folder.

###Week 0
Worked on understanding static site generation - looked at hugo, pelican, jekyll and octopress. Finally setup my personal blog with jekyll.

###Week 1
Played with Viper on the Arduino Due. Understood the work flow and complexities involved in porting the python runtime to a microcontroller system.

###Week 2
Played with front end design. Used HTML5 and CSS3. Will follow this up with an hackend on responsive design.

###Week 3
Worked with Python and C extensions. Tried ctypes, swig and python/c api. My write up was accepted as a chapter in the book [intermediate python](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/python_c_extension.html).
